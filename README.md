## Hi, I’m Akshitha 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate (B.Tech CSE ’27) with a growing interest in backend development and a long-term goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I enjoy understanding how systems work behind the scenes, from handling data and logic to connecting everything into a complete application.

I like building projects, solving problems, and improving my skills by exploring backend technologies and frameworks, while also working on frontend fundamentals to support end-to-end development. 
I’m particularly interested in building reliable, scalable features and gradually expanding into full-stack systems.

🛠 Tech Stack
- Languages: JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, C
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
